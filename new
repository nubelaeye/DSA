# Today we will talk about the Tensors
# Tensor :- Tensors are only ML generalistaion of vectors and matrices into any number of dimensions.
# Types of Tensors:-
    # 1. Scalar :-
        # * No Dimension
        # * Single Number
        # * Denoted in lowercase Italics
        # * Should be typed, like all other tensors -> e.g. int, float.
        
    # 2. Vectors :-
        # * 1 Dimension
        # * Arranged in an order, so element can be accessed by its index.
        # * Vectors of two length represents location in 2D Matrix
        
    # 3. Matrix :- 
        # About Matrix you will know in Matrix Lecture.
        
    # And there a nDimensional Tensors
        
# Zero Vector :- 
    # These vectors are used for the creating an array the number of zeros u want.
    
# Unit Vector :-
    # When vectors's length is equal to one. These types of vectors are called Unit Vector.
